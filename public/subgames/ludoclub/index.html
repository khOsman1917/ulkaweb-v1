            on the Moonfrog Labs domain, and information made available by users to each other through the Moonfrog Labs
            Software (collectively, the “Service”). Your privacy is important to us and, as described in this Privacy
            Policy, we have designed the Service to protect information about you from unauthorized disclosure to
            others. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use and, in certain circumstances, share your
            personally identifying information. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully, and if you have any
            questions, feel free to contact us.<br /><br />
            By registering for, accessing, using, and/or downloading any Service, you agree to Moonfrog Labs’ Privacy
            Policy and that you will abide by Moonfrog Labs’ Terms of Service. Among other things, you consent to the
            collection and use of your personal information as outlined in this Privacy Policy, as such policy may be
            amended from time to time. We may update the Privacy Policy and if we do, we will post a notice that changes
            have been made on the website www.moonfroglabs.com. You should visit this page periodically to review any

          <div class="bold_heading">What We Collect</div>
          <p style="margin-right: 40px;text-align: justify">Moonfrog Labs gives you a number of options regarding what
            information you will give us:<br /><br />
            When you register a profile with Moonfrog Labs, your profile including any information (name, address,
            gender) will be registered with Moonfrog Labs. When you identify yourself on a Moonfrog Labs site, you may
            identify yourself using a Moonfrog Labs account. When you identify yourself on a Moonfrog Labs site, you may
            identify yourself through a social network account in which Moonfrog Labs may receive additional information
            about your profile.<br /><br />
            In each case, we will collect and record the information you have provided. Other than names and email
            addresses provided at your discretion, we don’t generally collect any “Personally Identifying Information”
            about our users (such as social security number, street address, drivers license number, etc.), exception
            being for billing and payments where we store your billing information such as name, street address, phone
            number. We may offer you the opportunity to submit other information about yourself (such as gender, age,
            occupation, hobbies, interests, zip code, etc.), or we may be able to collect that information from social
            networking systems on which you have used Moonfrog Labs Games or SNS Apps (in accordance with the terms of
            use of those systems), which would then also be covered by this Privacy Policy.<br /><br />
            In addition to information about yourself, you may choose to share information about yourself in other
            content (“Content”), such as in games. Any action you perform with other players are considered public, and
            at your own discretion.<br /><br />
            When you use an SNS App on your social network page or use an SNS App on someone else’s page, we may record
            information regarding the use of that SNS App, and we may collect other information that is visible on your
            social network page in accordance with the relevant terms of use associated with that page.<br /><br />
            Note that since most Moonfrog Labs Software is served through SNS Apps, it is your responsibility to read
            and accept their Terms of Use, as well as Privacy Policy prior to continuing.<br /><br />
            When you use a Mobile App, which includes telephones and other devices such as tablets, you agree that
            information about your use of the Service through your mobile device and carrier may be communicated to us.
            This information includes, but is not limited to your carrier, device, geo-location, IP address, telephone
            number, country or other information you provide. With your permission, we may also access your contacts.
            Your carrier’s standard fees and rates will still apply, including without limitation SMS/text messaging
            fees, and you accept responsibility for all charges.<br /><br />
            When you invite new members into your network or send messages through the Service, we collect and maintain
            on secure servers the information associated with those messages, including email addresses and
            content.<br /><br />
            We may use information about you that we collect from other sources, including but not limited to newspapers
            and Internet sources such as blogs, instant messaging services, Moonfrog Labs Games and other users of
            Moonfrog Labs, to supplement your profile.<br /><br />
            Moonfrog Labs may contain links to other websites. We are of course not responsible for the privacy
            practices of other web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site to read the
            privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This
            Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by Moonfrog Labs.<br /><br />
            You should also be aware that most content delivered through Moonfrog Labs Games originates with another
            content provider. Such other content providers may place “cookies” on your browser, or otherwise gather
            information about you, including by asking you to provide information through the site itself.<br /><br />
            Finally, in order to provide the best possible service and to allow us to make certain internal reports and
            make recommendations, we collect aggregate information about the use of the Service, including information
            about users accessing the Moonfrog Labs site, playing Moonfrog Labs Games, using SNS Apps on other sites or
            using Mobile Apps, such as internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser language, referring / exit
            pages and URLs, other browser history, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages
            viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time
            (“Activity Information”).<br /><br />
            By using the Service, you consent to our retaining all the above-described information in anonymous form as
            long as Moonfrog Labs sees fit.

            address so that person may be invited to join Moonfrog Labs or so that we may facilitate your communication
            with other people through the Service (such as when you upload an address book).<br /><br />
            You may also provide us with another person’s contact information for purposes of delivering information

            All invitees are provided with the option not to receive further invitations from Moonfrog Labs. We may
            disclose such information if required to do so in order to comply with legal process, as described

            the Moonfrog Labs site, or otherwise view content through a Moonfrog Labs Game, or use an SNS App or Mobile
            App, and the Service uses such cookies as described in here. The Service uses cookies to improve the quality
            of our service, make recommendations, and make the Service easier to use for our users. A cookie is a small

            content in Moonfrog Labs Games, Mobile Apps and SNS Apps may be hosted by other web sites. In addition, as
            described above, most content offered through Moonfrog Labs Games or SNS Apps is served or hosted by other

          <p style="margin-right: 40px;text-align: justify">We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our
            site and on certain Moonfrog Labs Games, Mobile Apps and SNS Apps. Our system and the third-party
            advertising technology uses information derived from Activity Information, Moonfrog Labs’ cookies, your
            visits to our site, the Moonfrog Labs Games that you view and the SNS Apps and Mobile Apps you use to target
            advertising within our site, Moonfrog Labs Games, Mobile Apps or SNS Apps. In addition, our advertisers may
            use other third-party advertising technology to target advertising on our site and other sites. In the
            course of advertisements being served to you, a unique third-party cookie or cookies may be placed on your
            device. Similarly, third-party advertising companies may provide us with pixel tags (also called “clear
            gifs” or “beacons”) to help manage and optimize our online advertising. Beacons enable us to recognize a
            browser’s cookie when a browser visits the site on which the beacon is located, and to learn which banner
            ads bring users to a given site.<br /><br />
            Moonfrog Labs does not provide any Personally Identifiable Information to third-party advertising companies.
            Note, however, that if an advertiser asks Moonfrog Labs to show an advertisement to users with certain
            characteristics (for example, women ages 18-24) or a segment of that group (for example, women ages 18-24
            who have viewed certain categories of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the third-party
            advertising company may conclude that you have the characteristics of the audience that they are trying to
            reach.<br /><br />

          <p style="margin-right: 40px;text-align: justify">Moonfrog Labs takes appropriate precautions to protect our
            users’ information. Your account information is located on a secured server behind a firewall. When you
            enter sensitive information (such as credit card number or your password), we encrypt that information using
            secure socket layer technology (SSL). (To learn more about SSL, go to
            http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer). However, regardless of the precautions taken by you or
            by us, “perfect security” does not exist on the Internet. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect
            your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private
            communications will always remain private. We cannot ensure or warrant the ultimate security of any
            information you transmit. Because email and instant messaging are not recognized as secure communications,
            we request that you not send private information to us by email or instant messaging services. If you have
            any questions about the security of Moonfrog Labs Web Site, please contact us at
